Description: Implements the algorithm described in Trapnell,C. et al. (2010) <doi: 10.1038/nbt.1621>. This function takes read counts matrix of RNA-Seq data, feature lengths which can be retrieved using 'biomaRt' package, and the mean fragment lengths which can be calculated using the 'CollectInsertSizeMetrics(Picard)' tool. It then returns a matrix of FPKM normalised data by library size and feature effective length. It also provides the user with a quick and reliable function to generate FPKM heatmap plot of the highly variable features in RNA-Seq dataset.
